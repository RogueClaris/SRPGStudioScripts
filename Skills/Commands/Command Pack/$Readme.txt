Hello, and welcome to the Skill Command script suite! This set of scripts contains the following additions to your project:

1) A-Master-Command, which inserts a new command called "Skills" in to your unit's command list. No setup is required for this one.

2) Berserk-Strike, which enables an attack dealing +50% damage at the cost of one-third of your unit's current health, and a 15% accuracy penalty. Instructions on creation are found in Berserk-Strike.js!

3) Defend, which enables the addition of a state-granting skill which will reduce damage intake in exchange for the unit's turn. Setup instructions are found in Defend.js!

4) Rest, which enables a unit to inflict themselves with a state. Setup instructions are found in Rest.js!

Defend, Rest, and Berserk-Strike can all have their in-game commands renamed using the custom parameter {custName:"Name"}. Put whatever you want in the quotes, and that's what will show up.
